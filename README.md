### Hey, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I work at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. My goal is to make household robots a reality.

- ðŸŽ“ I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/).
- ðŸ¤– My research explores ways in which robots can acquire representations, from videos and natural language, that are useful for manipulation.
- ðŸ“š I'm passionate about writing. I frequently [blog](https://blog.kzakka.com/) and write [tutorials](https://kevinzakka.github.io/).
- ðŸ’» I previously interned at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/robotics/) and [X, The Moonshot Factory](https://x.company/) (formerly Google X).

If it sounds like we might get along, [hit me up](mailto:zakka@berkeley.edu).
